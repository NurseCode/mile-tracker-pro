# MileTracker Pro - Local APK Build Guide

## Full-Featured App Ready for Build

Your MileTrackerPro folder contains the complete application with ALL advanced features:

✅ **GPS Tracking** (expo-location) - Automatic and manual trip detection
✅ **Receipt Camera** (expo-camera) - Photo capture with cropping
✅ **File Export** (expo-file-system) - Professional CSV generation

✅ **File Sharing** (expo-sharing) - Native sharing capabilities

## Option 1: Local EAS Build (Recommended)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- At least 8GB RAM available
- 10GB free disk space

### Steps
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd MileTrackerPro

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Login to Expo (one-time setup)
npx eas login

# Build APK locally (preserves all features)
npx eas build --platform android --local --profile preview
```

**Result**: Full-featured APK file ready for installation

## Option 2: Development Build (Alternative)

```bash
# Create development client
npx eas build --platform android --profile development --local

# Install once on phone, then use for testing
# Updates pushed over-the-air without rebuilding
```

## Option 3: Export for Android Studio

```bash
# Generate native Android project
npx expo run:android --device

# Open android/ folder in Android Studio
# Build APK through Android Studio interface
```

## Key Advantages of Local Build

1. **Full Feature Preservation** - All expo plugins work correctly
2. **Memory Control** - Use your machine's full resources
3. **No EAS Server Issues** - Bypass cloud build limitations
4. **Complete Control** - Debug and customize as needed
5. **Production Ready** - Same quality as Play Store builds

## Expected Build Time
- Local EAS Build: 15-30 minutes
- Development Build: 10-20 minutes
- Android Studio: 20-40 minutes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter memory issues:
- Close other applications
- Use `--clear-cache` flag
- Build in development profile first (smaller)

Your app will have identical functionality to commercial apps like MileIQ but at $4.99/month instead of $9.99/month.
