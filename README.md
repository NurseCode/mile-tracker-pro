### Build Process

GitHub Actions automatically builds production APK:
1. Upload code to repository
2. GitHub builds APK automatically (15-20 minutes)  
3. Download APK from Releases or Actions artifacts
4. Install on Android device for testing

### Native Components Included

- `BackgroundLocationService.java` - Core GPS background service
- `MileTrackerGPSModule.java` - React Native bridge integration
- `AndroidManifest.xml` - Background location permissions
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated APK builds

### Installation

1. Download APK from GitHub Releases
2. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Android settings
3. Install APK on device
4. Grant location permissions when prompted
5. Background GPS tracking starts automatically

The app will show "Background GPS Active" notification when tracking and continues working even when completely closed.

### Ready for Google Play Store

This implementation is production-ready for Google Play Store deployment with professional-grade background GPS functionality that competes directly with commercial mileage tracking applications.
